         <summary>Our Story</summary>
         <p>TGS, also known as The Golden Snubs, was founded over 15 days ago by four friends
            with a passion for fashion: Hansaint Noto, Carlos Posadas, Abdurrehman Aslam, and Ghazi
            Harara. Our goal is to sell clothes, but mostly to make money.

         <summary>Meet the Founders</summary>
         <h2>Hansaint Noto</h2>
         <p>Hansaint is a fashion enthusiast who loves to keep up with the latest trends. He has a
            keen eye for design and ensures that every piece of clothing sold by TGS is stylish and
            on-trend.
         </p>
         <h2>Carlos Posadas</h2>
         <p>Carlos is a marketing genius who knows how to create buzz around a brand. He is
            responsible for TGS's social media presence and has helped us gain a loyal following in a short
            amount of time.
         </p>
         <h2>Abdurrehman Aslam</h2>
         <p>Abdurrehman is the numbers guy at TGS. He ensures that our finances are in order
            and that we are making a profit. He also helps us make strategic business decisions that will
            help us grow.
         </p>
         <h2>Ghazi Harara</h2>
         <p>Ghazi is a former criminal who loves to make stupid amounts of money. He once
            started a lemonade stand and tricked 3rd graders to run and operate it for no compensation. He
            was once accused of robbing the federal reserve but his lawyer has advised him to not speak of
            it.
